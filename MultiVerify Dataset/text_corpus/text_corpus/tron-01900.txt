Summary of eRumor: This is a forwarded email or a Facebook post of an article that alleged that November has been set aside by President Obama to celebrate National Muslim Appreciation. The Truth: The article was found to be posted on September 27, 2013 by a website called, “The National Report.” This is a political satire site and nothing posted there should be considered serious or valid. The website recently reported that President Obama had a mental breakdown and was under medical care at the White House.   That was a joke as well.
