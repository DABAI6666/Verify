The malware is said to be capable of hacking into a user's cell phone in under 10 seconds, wreaking irreparable damage: Warning from An Garda. An IT expert has advised that a video comes out tomorrow from WhatsApp called martinelli do not open it , it hacks your phone and nothing will fix it. Spread the word Tomorrow comes a video for whatsapp is called martinelli do not open it hacks the phone in 10 seconds and you can not stop in any way pass the data to yours and friends This warning is a hoax, one that appears to have originated in a Spanish-language version sometime in 2017.
