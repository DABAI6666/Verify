City Councilman Carl DeMaio recently crossed the border and declared he was the first mayoral candidate to ever visit Baja California during the election season. So was DeMaio telling the truth? In this edition of Fact Check TV, Scott Lewis reviews the archives of San Diego‚Äôs election history and explains whether the claim was true or false. Lewis also discusses the latest shakeup in San Diego‚Äôs media landscape. Last week, hotelier and U-T San Diego owner Doug Manchester bought the county‚Äôs second-largest newspaper , the North County Times. New episodes of Fact Check TV appear on NBC 7 San Diego every Friday during the 6 p.m. newscast and our website the following Monday. What should we feature on our next episode?
