General Peter Cosgrove Interview on Australian TV-Fiction! / Celebrities , Military / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 General Peter Cosgrove Interview on Australian TV- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: This is a forwarded email that contains a transcript of an alleged interview that took place on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) between General Peter Cosgrove, the former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, and ABC host Leigh Sales.  Sales was concerned about a group of Boy Scouts being taught by the general on how to properly handle a rifle.  Sales asked if he was “equipping them to become violent killers.”   The general quickly responded, “Well, Ma’am, you’re equipped to be a prostitute, but you’re not one, are you?”    After a long period of silence the interview ended. The Truth: The story is a hoax according to a February 4, 2013  article by The Australian .  Calling it a “complete fabrication,” the article said that a transcript of the alleged broadcast went viral on the World Wide Web. The article also said, “Since President Barack Obama began his fight to toughen gun laws in the US, more than 18,000 Facebook members have shared what appears to be a transcript of an interview between General Cosgrove and an unnamed female journalist discussing a Boy Scout trip to ‘military headquarters'”. The sample that we got named Leigh Sales of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation as the interview host.   Some versions of this whopper say the interview took place on the CNN network.
