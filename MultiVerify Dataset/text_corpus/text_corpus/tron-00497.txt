Bald eagles change their lives at 40-Fiction! / Animals , Inspirational / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Inspirational Story of the “Rebirth” of The Eagle- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: The eRumor says that eagles can live to be 70, but in order to reach that age it makes a painful decision in its 40s.  At that time the eagle goes through a 150-day change that extends the eagle’s life that includes breaking off the beak and feathers so new ones can grow. The Truth: This email, which often includes pictures of eagles and is sometimes a PowerPoint presentation, is a complete myth. According to the folks at www.baldeagleinfo.com , “An eagle’s beak and talons grow continuously, because they are made of keratin, the same as human hair and fingernails.”  Also, the molting process, when the feathers are slowly replaced, takes place each year but not all the feathers are replaced each time.  “An eagle without feathers, talons, and a beak would die of starvation and exposure,” according to the site.
