Barack Obama Quotes The Bible?-Fiction! / Politics / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Barack Obama Gets Mixed up Quoting his Favorite Bible Verse- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: The eRumor says that Barack Obama tried to demonstrate his commitment to faith during a speech by quoting his favorite Bible verse.  He meant to refer to John 3:16 but referenced John 16:3 instead, with humorous results. The Truth: This is one of those eRumors that gets circulated every election year…with the name of your least favorite candidate inserted. It’s a hoax and never happened to Barack Obama. The story has also been spread using the names of John Kerry, Al Gore and George W. Bush. Christian author Cal Thomas, however, says he was present at a convention in Washington, D.C. when that slip of the lip did occur…but to then President George Bush, not Al Gore. updated 11/12/08 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
