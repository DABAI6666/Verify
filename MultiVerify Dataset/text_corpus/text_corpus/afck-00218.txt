We weigh up key claims Published on 02 June 2016 This article is more than 8 years old The Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa’s official opposition party, rules 26 municipalities in South Africa. They are aiming to add municipalities like Nelson Mandela Bay, Tshwane and Tlokwe to the list in the upcoming local government election. Their 68-page manifesto is titled “Change that moves South Africa forward again”. In the first pages, DA leader Mmusi Maimane spells out the DA’s vision for local government saying that “this document does not only make promises of a better future, it illustrates the progress we have already made in the municipalities we currently govern”. Here we evaluate are key claims in the DA’s manifesto about their past performance in local government. ( Note: We aren’t able to fact-check promises but will keep an eye on whether they are fulfilled .) We have also fact-checked the manifestos of the African National Congress and the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF): Is the ANC ‘advancing people’s power’? We fact-check key election claims Is the EFF your ‘last hope for service delivery’? We evaluate their manifesto Employment Claim “More than 8.2 million South Africans do not have a job.” Verdict mostly-correct When the DA launched their manifesto on 23 April 2016 , the latest available data on unemployment in South Africa was from July to September 2015 . That data showed that 5,418,000 people were unemployed then , according to the narrow definition. These people are unemployed but tried to find a job in the last four weeks. The latest data, from January to March 2016, shows that the number has risen to 5,714,000 . The expanded definition of unemployment includes discouraged job-seekers. These are people who want to work but are not actively trying to find employment. According to the expanded definition, there were 8,304,000 unemployed people in South Africa in July to September 2015. This figure rose to 8,927,000 in the first quarter of 2016. READ: Unemployment statistics in South Africa explained Claim “Estimates by the City [of Cape Town] found that 161,000 individuals, or 11.3% of the total workforce in Cape Town, were employed by the informal economy in 2015.” Verdict mostly-correct The estimates of the number of Capetonians working in the informal economy were included in a report on Economic Performance Indicators for Cape Town for the second quarter of 2015, the DA told Africa Check. The informal employment sector, as measured by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), includes people informally employed, as well as people working in the formal sector or private households, but without a written contract or benefits such as medical aid or pension fund contributions. The DA’s claim is correct for the second quarter of 2015, Stats SA’s quarterly labour force survey shows. 2015 Informal employees in City of Cape Town % of total employment Unemployment rate Jan-Mar 135,000 9.5% 23.5% April-June 161,000 11.3% 22.6% July-Sept 171,000 11.6% 21.9% Oct-Dec 175,000 11.6% 20.5% Source: Stats SA quarterly labour force survey (Jan-March 2016) But the size of Cape Town’s informal sector employment as a proportion of total employment is low relative to other metropolitan municipalities in South Africa, professor Dieter von Fintel of the Stellenbosch University’s economic department, told Africa Check. Von Fintel said that only Tshwane’s proportion was lower than Cape Town’s. In turn, South Africa has a comparatively low informal sector share when compared to many developing countries. Claim “Midvaal [has] the lowest unemployment rate in Gauteng.” Verdict correct The DA said their claim is based on 2011 census data, which showed that the Midvaal local municipality’s unemployment rate was then at 18.8% . Compared to the 3 metropolitan municipalities and 6 other local municipalities in the Gauteng province, Midvaal had the lowest unemployment figures in 2011. Municipality Unemployment rate in 2011 Emfuleni 34.7% Westonaria 29.5% Ekurhuleni 28.8% Merafong City 27.2% Randfontein 27.1% Lesedi 25% City of Johannesburg 25% Mogale City 24.6% City of Tshwane 24.2% Midvaal 18.8% In 2001, the year after the DA first won Midvaal’s local government election , census data shows that the unemployment rate was 22.8% . Claim “Since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed South Africans through [the Expanded Public Works Programme].” Verdict correct In support of the claim, DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme pointed Africa Check to a City of Cape Town media release from July 2015 . It stated that “since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed residents through this programme”. This is backed up by the City of Cape Town’s annual reports, in which they reported creating 140,324 work opportunities between 2011/12 and 2014/15. ( Note: As Africa Check has previously explained , the number of opportunities does not correspond to the number of people who have benefited from the programme. Someone can be employed on different projects in the programme at different times with each work period counted as a separate job opportunity. ) Financial year Work opportunities reported 2011/12 26,403 2012/13 35,556 2013/14 38,305 2014/15 40,060 Total 140,324 Source: City of Cape Town annual reports Claim The City of Cape Town’s "rate of unemployment" was 20.5% in 2013/14.
