Dan Evon Published May 8, 2015 Claim: A new tranquilizer dart gun on the market is designed to put children to sleep. Rating: False About this rating On 8 May 2015, the web site Newswatch 28 published an article reporting that the FDA had approved a new tranquilizer dart to put children to sleep: The Food and Drug Association (FDA) has announced this morning that it has approved pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson's request to produce and sell tranquilizer dart guns specially developed to put kids to sleep.

Regardless of public opinion, the FDA has not approved a tranquilizer dart to put children to sleep. While the above-displayed photograph does feature a child snoozing in a humorous sleeping position, the tranquilizer dart was added to the image via Photoshop. The origins of the photo are unknown, but it has been circulating online as a demotivational poster since at least 2010: By Dan Evon Dan Evon is a former writer for Snopes.
