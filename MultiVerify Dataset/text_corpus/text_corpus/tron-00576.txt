Chick-fil-A Will Be Open on Sundays Beginning in October-Fiction! / Business / By Rich Buhler & Staff / September 10, 2015 Chick-fil-A Will Be Open on Sundays Beginning in October- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: In a reversal of the company’s long-standing policy, Chick-fil-A has announced that its restaurants will be open on Sundays beginning in October. The Truth: There’s no truth to reports that Chick-fil-A will be open for business beginning in October. The rumor quickly spread across social media sites, but it’s not clear exactly where it started. Chick-fil-A responded directly to a number of posts: This is not true. However, we’d love to see you Monday through Sunday! Chick-fil-A has been closed on Sundays ever since the first restaurant opened back in the 1940s, and that’s not going to change anytime soon. The company has explained the policy on its website: Thanks for asking. Our founder, Truett Cathy, made the decision to close on Sundays in 1946 when he opened his first restaurant in Hapeville, Georgia. He believed that all franchised Chick-fil-A Operators and Restaurant employees should have an opportunity to rest and spend time with family and friends. That’s why all Chick-fil-A Restaurants are closed on Sundays. It’s part of our recipe for success. That being said, we will continue to remain closed on Sundays. The research firm PrivCo has estimated that Chick-fil-A closing on Sundays costs the franchise about $190 million a year.
