Statement: ‚Äú(Carl DeMaio) also proposes eliminating the Deferred Retirement Option Plan (DROP), which costs the city approximately $150 million annually by allowing city employees to return to a salaried job while concurrently drawing their retirement payouts,‚Äù Carl DeMaio, San Diego councilman and mayoral candidate, on his campaign website. Determination: False Analysis: There‚Äôs no more notorious pension benefit than DROP. The benefit allows employees to retire but keep working and earn a salary. They also earn a pension, which accrues in an account and later is paid out with interest. DeMaio proposes to eliminate DROP as part of his mayoral platform. But his campaign website gave the wrong timeframe for the plan‚Äôs costs. He said it costs $150 million annually. Actually, the $150 million price tag is spread over a long time, according to a February city analysis . The analysis doesn‚Äôt give any specific timeframe, but Independent Budget Analyst Andrea Tevlin provided a rough estimate of 80 years. It‚Äôs worth noting that the $150 million figure is in today‚Äôs dollars and doesn‚Äôt account for inflation. DeMaio‚Äôs campaign spokesman acknowledged the error and said the claim would be corrected right away. The website now says the $150 million cost comes ‚Äúover the life of the program.‚Äù If you disagree with our determination or analysis, please express your thoughts in the comments section of this blog post.
