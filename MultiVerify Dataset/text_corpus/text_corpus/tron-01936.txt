Summary of eRumor: A report that claims a PETA member who protested bikers for wearing leather was gagged and duct taped to a tree has gone viral. The Truth: A PETA protestor wasn’t gagged and duct taped to a tree by a gang of bikers for protesting leather clothes commonly worn by motorcyclists. A fake news website called Glossy News (it used to be called The Spoof ) started that rumor with a fictional report that first appeared in 2010: Local and state police scoured the hills outside rural Johnstown, Pennsylvania, after reports of three animal rights activists going missing after attempting to protest the wearing of leather at a large motorcycle gang rally this weekend. Two others, previously reported missing, were discovered by fast food workers “duct taped inside fast food restaurant dumpsters,” according to police officials. The photo of the man duct taped to the tree did not appear in the original article. It’s original source isn’t known. It has appeared on various sites depicting fraternity hazing or what can happen to an employee with a history of tardiness. updated 8/10/15 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
