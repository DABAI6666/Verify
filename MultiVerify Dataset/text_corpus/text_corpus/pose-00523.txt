"Homeowners should take comfort in knowing that their home is truly their castle, which is why I support citizens’ rights to protect themselves in their own homes and anywhere they have a legal right to be, by adopting a strong Castle Doctrine law" All of the Walk-O-Meter Walk-O-Meter Not yet rated Scott Walker By James B. Nelson December 7, 2011 After some legislative battles, Walker's signature brings this one home On Dec. 7, 2011, Gov. Scott Walker signed Assembly Bill 69 , what became known as the "castle doctrine” bill. The new law "creates a presumption of immunity in criminal and civil actions for individuals who use deadly force against a trespasser who has unlawfully or forcibly entered their home, motor vehicle, or place of business,” the governor said in a news release . The immunity wouldn't apply to people who were using their home or other property for crimes such as drug dealing. It also wouldn't shield a shooter who attacked someone who he or she knew or should have known was a police officer, firefighter or emergency medical technician. "This bill will deter future criminal intrusions as well as provide added legal protections for those who use force to protect their home or property,” the news release said. Walker fulfilled his "castle doctrine” promise. That makes it a Promise Kept. Our Sources Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, "Walker to sign ‘castle doctrine" bill Wednesday,” Dec. 7, 2011 Gov. Scott Walker news release, "Gov. Walker: To sign 21 bills this afternoon,” Dec. 7, 2011.
