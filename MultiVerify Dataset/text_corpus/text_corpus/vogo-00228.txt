Statement: ‚ÄúTheir acceptance rate was as low as Harvard and Yale this year,‚Äù former President Bill Clinton said about UC San Diego during a June 5 interview with CNBC. Determination: False Analysis: Clinton gathered global leaders and thinkers at a conference in Chicago earlier this month to address some of the world‚Äôs biggest challenges: poverty, environment, education and health care.

In an interview with CNBC about the event, Clinton said Sanders, a Republican, had successfully worked alongside Democrats here to nurture small businesses. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs working in America are these cooperative clusters like we were talking about San Diego,‚Äù Clinton said, according to a transcript posted online . ‚ÄúSan Diego has become the human genome research capital of America.‚Äù Clinton backed up the notoriety by listing prominent science centers, such as the J. Craig Venter Institute and Qualcomm. He also described the amount of interest in attending UC San Diego as akin to Ivy League schools. ‚ÄúThere were 66,000 applications for the freshmen class at the University of California, San Diego. Their acceptance rate was as low as Harvard and Yale this year,‚Äù he said. But that‚Äôs not true, according to a survey of college admissions by The New York Times. Harvard and Yale accepted about 6 percent and 7 percent of applicants this year. UCSD accepted nearly 38 percent. We tried reaching Clinton for comment through conference organizers, but a representative did not respond before our deadline. However, UC San Diego spokesman Jeff Gattas provided some insight into why the mistake might‚Äôve happened. Clinton could‚Äôve mixed up the university‚Äôs acceptance rate (the number of applicants who get in) with its enrollment rate (the number of approved applicants who actually enroll in classes). Most people accepted to UC San Diego decide not to enroll. They might end up choosing another school or none at all. That‚Äôs different than Harvard and Yale, where most decide to enroll after their acceptance. UC San Diego isn‚Äôt as selective as those Ivy League schools, which is what Clinton suggested. UC San Diego‚Äôs freshman enrollment rate is much closer to Harvard and Yale, however. Last fall, UC San Diego enrolled about 6 percent of applicants. The other schools enrolled about 5 percent, according to statistics from the Times and The Princeton Review . The mix-up could explain why Clinton described acceptance rates as equal among UC San Diego, Harvard and Yale, but it doesn‚Äôt change the inaccuracy of the comparison or our rating. The statement was False. If you disagree with our determination or analysis, please express your thoughts in the comments section of this blog post. Explain your reasoning.
