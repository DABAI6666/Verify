Billy Graham-revival in the streets in New Orleans-Fiction! / Religious / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Thousands Follow Billy Graham into the Streets of New Orleans During Crusade- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: The story says that during the final night of an evangelistic crusade in New Orleans, the aging evangelist Billy Graham led more than 16,000 people onto Bourbon street where a revival-like event took place, but the media didn’t cover it. The Truth: This story is a fabrication. Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son and heir to his ministry, led a Celebration of Hope in new Orleans on March 11 and 12, 2006. Billy Graham did appear at the event but this story of his leading the crowd into the streets of New Orleans is fiction. The reason the media did not cover it is because it did not happen.
