Summary of eRumor: The eRumor claims that the U.S. National Transportation and Safety Board has installed voice recorders in some 4-wheel drive and recreational vehicles, similar to the “black boxes” in airliners.  The eRumor says that the last words of drivers in fatal crashes in Southern states were “Hold my beer, I’m gonna try somethin” The Truth: We’ve received questions at TruthOrFiction.com from people who took this story seriously.
