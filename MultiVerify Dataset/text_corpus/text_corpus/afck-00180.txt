Zuma's 10th State of the Nation Address checked Published on 10 February 2017 This article is more than 7 years old Amidst unprecedented security measures , South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech . Energy Claim “To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity." Verdict correct South Africa’s development indicators showed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further 233,455 were connected in 2014/15 and 231,012 were connected in 2015/16 . Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released. Zuma’s claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016. As of 2016, 90,3% of South African households had access to electricity for lighting. - Kate Wilkinson Education Claim "Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science." Verdict correct The Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science. Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested. The 2015 study found that South Africa’s Grade 9 pupils recorded the “ biggest positive change ”. There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics. The report goes on to note that “South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015”. While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa’s Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate Wilkinson READ: South African pupils not ‘second worst in the world’ in maths & science Claim “Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.” Verdict misleading The media unit of the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check to a lengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year . It stated that “t he historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved”. However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university. First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students.

Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students’ previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015. Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students’ academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meet graduation requirements during their final year of study . Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or “capital” amount owed by the student to the university. Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students’ historic debt. NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand’s NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that “some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS”. As such, the “historical debt” has not been “settled” but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading. - Vinayak Bhardwaj READ : FACTSHEET: Funding & the changing face of SA’s public universities Claim "A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011." Verdict correct The department of basic education replaces unsafe and “inappropriate” school structures under the Accelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative (Asidi) programme which started in 2011. As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced, a department presentation to the select committee on basic education showed. At the time of Zuma’s speech, the department’s figures showed that 173 had been replaced . The latest figure displayed on the department’s website puts the number of schools at 174. The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially, 496 schools were identified as “inappropriate structures”. Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14. - Kate Wilkinson Employment Claim “In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%. The representation of coloureds stood at 4.5%, and Indians 8.7%.” Verdict incorrect The commission for employment equity compiles an annual report on employment equity for the department of labour. The data in the report is submitted once a year by designated employers, which include employers who employ 50 or more employees, employers who employ fewer than 50 employees but have a certain annual turnover, as well as municipalities, all levels of government, state-owned companies and educational institutions. The 2015/16 annual report showed that 68.9% of top management workforce was white, 14.3% was black, 8.6% was Indian, 4.7% was coloured and 3.5% was foreign. The breakdown of management levels by population group: Top management Senior management Professionally qualified Skilled technical Black 14.3% 21.2% 41.2% 58.8% White 68.9% 58.1% 38.0% 22.0% Indian 8.6% 10.2% 8.5% 5.9% Coloured 4.7% 7.4% 9.4% 11.6% Foreign 3.5% 3.1% 2.8% 1.7% - Kate Wilkinson Claim “The expanded public works program has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities towards the attainment of the target of 6 million work opportunities by the end of March 2019.” Verdict correct Data from the expanded public works programme supports Zuma’s claim. Nearly 2.5 million job opportunities were created between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. Total work opportunities 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 497,624 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 741,540 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 1,103,983 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 154,965 Total 2,498,112 Work opportunities are not permanent jobs, however, and in most cases only last a few months. The department of public works notes that “the same individual can be employed on different projects and each period of employment will be counted as a work opportunity ”. So while nearly 2.5 million work opportunities were created, this does not mean that the same number of people benefited from the programme. - Kate Wilkinson Claim “Of the [more than 2 million] work opportunities created, more than 1 million have been taken up by the youth.” Verdict correct This claim followed on from Zuma’s previous statement, in which he said that “the expanded public works programme has since 2014 created more than 2 million work opportunities”. Africa Check was unable to find fourth quarter figures for 2013/14. However, even without them, the expanded public works programme reports show that 1,129,516 job opportunities were filled by young people. This was 45% of all work opportunities over the period. - Kate Wilkinson Total work opportunities for youth 1 April 2016 - 31 December 2016 222,587 1 April 2015 - 31 March 2016 340,663 1 April 2014 - 31 March 2015 566,265 1 January 2014 - 31 March 2014 - Total 1,129,516 Income inequality Claim “White households earn at least 5 times more than black households, according to Statistics South Africa.” Verdict mostly-correct Statistics South Africa’s 2014/15 Living Conditions of Households Survey reported that black African households had an average income of R92,983 per year.
