Congressman Brian Bilbray is campaigning for re-election and recently made a bold claim during a debate with his competitors, Port Commissioner Scott Peters and former Assemblywoman Lori Salda√±a. Bilbray said : If you think Congress doesn‚Äôt have enough to control, think about this: It took an act of Congress just to hold a sailboat race in San Diego. That shows you how far we‚Äôve gone in the wrong direction. Bilbray was referring to the America‚Äôs Cup, an international sailing competition that was held in San Diego last November. Thousands of spectators watched the races, but did Congress actually rescue the event as Bilbray claimed? In this edition of Fact Check TV, Andrew Donohue and Scott Lewis examine what Congress did, if anything, for the sailboat race in San Diego and whether Bilbray‚Äôs description was accurate.
