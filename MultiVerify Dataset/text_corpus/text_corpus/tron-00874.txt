A virus for the cell phone-Fiction! / Computers , Miscellaneous , Warnings / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 If You Get a Call on Your Cell Phone With “ !?UNAVAILABLE!?” on the Display…It’s a Virus – Fiction! Summary of eRumor: This warning says that if your cell phone rings, if you have a display that allows you to see the caller ID of the person who is calling, and if “!?UNAVAILABLE!?” appears in that display, you should not answer the call because if you do, you’ll get a destructive virus in your phone.  The message warns that the virus will delete all the vital information in your phone and you’ll have to replace it. The Truth: This is a hoax.  There is no such reported virus.  Viruses are not spread through the mere answering of a typical telephone call on your cell phone.  Also, the message “Unavailable” on some cell phones means that you are receiving a call from someone whose caller ID is not available and is not an indication of trouble.
