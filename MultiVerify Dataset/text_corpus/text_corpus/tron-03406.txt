Summary of eRumor: An atheist allegedly filed a lawsuit in Florida objecting to Easter and Passover celebrations while atheists had no holiday to celebrate.  The judge dismisses the case and says the atheists do have their own holiday…April 1, April Fool’s Day. The Truth: This story is circulated with no specific such as when or where this alleged court case took place, the name of the atheist, or the name of the judge. We’ve never found any substantiation for it. Also, most ACLU cases objecting to religious activities are based on their alleged violation of separation of church and state, not the absence of an atheist’s holiday.
