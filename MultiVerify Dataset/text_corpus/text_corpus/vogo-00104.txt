Mayor Bob Filner doesn‚Äôt shy away from battles with hoteliers. They had another one recently over funding for the planned 2015 Centennial celebration at Balboa Park. Filner¬†said the Tourism Marketing District wouldn‚Äôt follow through on its promise to allocate a specific amount of cash for the event. The mayor initially refused to release cash to the district unless board members agreed to provide the money to the Centennial, nearly forcing the San Diego Tourism Authority to close its doors. He later released the cash when board members agreed to earmark nearly $500,000 for Centennial organizers. In the latest edition of Fact Check TV, Scott Lewis and I analyzed whether the contract between the city and the tourism district really mandated that hoteliers set aside money for the Balboa Park Centennial. We found the agreement wasn‚Äôt as clear as the mayor suggested.
