The 0.9% for NOTA in the 2018 Karnataka election is on the lower side when compared to the votes polled for NOTA in other state elections. For instance, NOTA polled 1.8% of the votes in Gujarat (2017 ), 2.5% in Bihar (2015) and 1.52% in West Bengal (2016) . NOTA polled the highest in Bangalore South constituency.  Here, NOTA polled 15829 votes and was in the 4th place after the three major parties. In 28 other constituencies, NOTA polled more than 2000 votes. Majority of these constituencies are in the urban areas. How many seats did BJP lose where NOTA vote was more than the margin? As per data released by the Election Commission of India (ECI), NOTA vote was more than the victory margin in only seven (7) constituencies in Karnataka.  These include Aland, Badami, Gadag, Hirekerur, Kungdol, Maski and Pavagada. Out of these constituencies, six were won by the Congress while Aland was won by the BJP. What about seats in the Bengaluru region? The 2 nd claim is about BJP losing 6 such seats in the Bengaluru area.  Out of the 28 seats in the Bengaluru region, elections were held in 26 while elections to two other seats were postponed. Out of the 26, BJP won 11 seats, Congress 13 seats and JD(S) won the remaining 2 seats. Out of the seats won by Congress & JD(S), there was not a single seat where the margin was less than the NOTA vote. In fact, except in Vijay Nagar, the margin exceeded the NOTA vote by at least 1000 votes. In Vijay Nagar, the margin exceeded the NOTA vote by 808 votes.
