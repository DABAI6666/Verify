Muslim Shirt Depicting Twin Towers in Flames–Unproven! / 9/11 Attack on America , Miscellaneous , Religious , Terrorism / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 30, 2015 Muslim Shirt Depicting Twin Towers in Flames– Unproven! Summary of eRumor: An email with the subject heading of “The Shirt” shows a photo of a man wearing a shirt that depicts the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, and claims that similar apparel is commonly sold by street vendors in Middle Eastern countries. The Truth: This picture has been circulating the Web for years, but there’s no information available about the man wearing the shirt, or who manufactured and sold it. Lettering pictured on the signs in the background also does not appear to be in Arabic, which would be found in Middle Eastern countries. There aren’t any other clues available to decipher where the photo was taken. The man in the photo is clearly wearing a shirt depicting the north and south towers burning. But information about merchandise sold by illegal and unregulated street vendors in foreign countries isn’t available to confirm or debunk the eRumor’s other claims.
