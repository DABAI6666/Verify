Result in Malware Infection -Virus! / Computers , Warnings / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Beware of Emailed Faxes Allegedly From eFax Corporation. They Could Result in Malware Infection – Virus! Summary of eRumor: This is a very convincing email that appears to look like an official fax sent from eFax Corporate. The Truth: In late September and early October 2012 emails cleverly disguised to appear as faxes sent from eFax Corporate, a service based in Los Angeles, California went viral on the World Wide Web.  These look official but they are a scam to trick computer users by redirecting them to web sites that could infect their computers, according to a September 24, 2012 article by the Examiner. The easiest way to check questionable emails is to hover the mouse (without clicking any buttons) over the links in the suspected emails.  Looking at the bottom border of the email window, an Internet location in the form of a URL to the website can be seen.   If that link does not appear to be from the company sending the email it is a very good indication that it is a redirecting scam. It is a good practice to never click links in unsolicited emails until the computer user is certain that the links are safe. updated 10/04/12 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
