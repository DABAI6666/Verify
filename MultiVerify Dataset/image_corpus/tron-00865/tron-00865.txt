Soflo Hack to Unlock iPhones Without Passkey-Fiction! / Computers / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 8, 2016 Soflo Hack to Unlock iPhones Without Passkey- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: A viral video claims that there’s a simple way to unlock iPhones without a password by entering the phrase “soflo” and following a number of steps to navigate to the home screen. The Truth: You can’t use the phrase “soflo” to unlock iPhones without the password. That rumor started with a viral video posted on Facebook. Within days of being posted on by user who goes by “SoFlo” on March 5, the video had already been viewed more than 52 million times. The hack (supposedly) starts with asking Siri what time it is from a locked home screen. From there, you’re can add a clock, type in the phrase “soflo,” and follow series of steps to bypass an iPhone’s password. But it’s totally false. Tech Harp pointed out in this video that SoFlo simply used the iPhone’s touch ID to unlock his iPhone at the beginning of the video. Then, after his phone was unlocked, SoFlo went through a series of pointless steps to make it appear that he’d bypassed the passkey by the end. This isn’t the first time SoFlo has given bad iPhone advice, either. In another video, he claims that you can charge an iPhone by placing it in a microwave and turning it on — a bogus (and dangerous) claim.
