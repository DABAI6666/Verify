Facebook Censored Obama Critics-Fiction! / Computers , Politics / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Facebook Censored Obama Critics- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: This is a forwarded email that said that the popular social network Facebook took down an image posted by a group that criticized President Obama’s handling of the attack on Benghazi. The Truth: Facebook took down the image but it was not intentional or an act of political censorship. The origin of this eRumor came from an October 30, 2012 article by Briebart , which might have been published too hastily.    We checked the article a day after it was published and found an update to the original story saying that the image was removed in error by Facebook: Facebook Manager Andrew Noyes emailed the following to Breitbart News this morning: We wanted to follow up on the Special Operations Speaks PAC (SOS) article published on Breitbart.com last night. I assure you that removing the image was not an act of censorship on our part. This was an error and we apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused. We also did some searching around Facebook and found the same image on the profile of Glenn Beck where the image still remains. updated 10/31/12 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
