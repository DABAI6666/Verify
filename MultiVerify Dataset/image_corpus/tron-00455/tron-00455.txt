Single Black Female Seeks Companionship-Unproven! / Animals / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Newspaper Ad Seeking Companionship for a Single was Actually About a Dog- Unproven! Summary of eRumor: The forwarded email talks about a singles ad allegedly placed in the Atlanta Journal newspaper that said that a “SINGLE BLACK FEMALE” sought companionship. The story says the phone number turned out to be for the Atlanta Humane Society and the ad was really for a dog. Fifteen-thousand calls were said to have been made to the Society. The Truth: This story has circulated on the Internet since about 2003 and has, to our knowledge, never been proven. Some versions say the ad appeared “in a newspaper” without identifying which one. Others versions have inserted the names of various newspapers including one that started appearing on the Internet in 2007 that said it was published in the Atlanta Journal in Georgia. That one has generated calls to the Atlanta Humane Society, mostly from people asking if it’s really true, but the Human Society said they did not place the ad and don’t know who did. Sometime along the way someone added the picture of the dog. updated 10/06/08 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
