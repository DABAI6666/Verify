Charlie Sheen announced on a November 17, 2015, appearance on the “Today” show that he had been diagnosed with HIV four years earlier.

Charlie Sheen revealed that he was HIV positive alongside his personal doctor, Dr. Robert Huizenga. After the interview with Lauer, Huizenga reiterated that Sheen did not have full-blown AIDS and said the actor was “healthy,” US Weekly reports : “Charlie has contracted the HIV virus. He was immediately put on treatment — strong antiviral drugs, which have suppressed the virus,” Huizenga continued. “Unfortunately, we don’t have a cure yet, but suppressed the virus to the point that he is absolutely healthy from that vantage, and my biggest concern with Charlie as a patient is substance abuse and depression from the disease more than what the HIV virus can do in terms of shortening his life, because it’s not going to.” As part of his treatment regiment for HIV, Charlie Sheen said that he takes four pills every day, and that maintaining his sobriety is one of the most challenging parts of his life.
