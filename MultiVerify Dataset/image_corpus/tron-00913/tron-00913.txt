Free Ericsson laptops?-Fiction! / Computers , Promises / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Ericsson is Giving Away Free Laptops for Forwarded Emails- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: An Internet giveaway message.  It encourages you to forward the email to 8 people and within 2 weeks Ericsson will send you a free Ericsson T18.  If you send it to 20 people you’ll receive a free Ericsson R320.  The message says Ericsson is giving away new WAP laptops. The Truth: There is no Ericsson laptop giveaway. Is a matter of fact there are no Ericsson T18 or R320 laptops. Ericsson is a cell phone company and both are models of cell phones. “WAP” refers to Wireless Application Protocol that does provide Internet content on a WAP-enabled device. Additionally, there is no system being used on the Internet to trace the pathways of forwarded emails to compensate you or anyone else. This email is a hoax. updated 3/7/07 Post navigation ← Previous Post Next Post → Copyright © 2024 What's True Incorporated Home Fact Checks Search News Support Us! x
