Statement: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be the first city that actually doesn‚Äôt subsidize it,‚Äù Mayor Jerry Sanders said during a Fox 5 interview about his bike-sharing plan. Determination: False Analysis: Earlier this week, Mayor Jerry Sanders announced a plan to bring bike-sharing to San Diego and promised the program wouldn‚Äôt cost taxpayers a dime. It would be funded solely by private investors. Bike sharing has been one way that cities try to increase public transit options. Cities set up unmanned bicycle stations around town. Then people pay membership or flat rates to rent bikes. One challenge, especially for cash-strapped cities like San Diego, has been funding the programs. Spending part of the city‚Äôs budget on a new bike program would mean diverting money from other services like libraries, parks and police. Sanders says San Diego could pioneer a privately funded program. During a Sept. 19 interview on Fox 5‚Äôs morning show , he made a bold claim about how his proposal stacks up against what other cities have done. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be the first city that actually doesn‚Äôt subsidize it. In other cities they pay for it,‚Äù Sanders said. We decided to Fact Check the comparison because Sanders‚Äô cited it to bolster his plan. Bike-sharing has been spreading across urban areas for years. Would cash-strapped San Diego be the first to not provide public subsidies? No, we found. The mayor was mistaken. Anaheim launched the first bike-sharing program in California last month and its funding does not include city money. Los Angeles also plans to launch a similar, privately funded program later this year. Sanders wants bike-sharing to be available in San Diego by next spring ‚Äî after both Anaheim and Los Angeles have their programs. San Diego wouldn‚Äôt be the first to have a privately-funded program. For that reason, we‚Äôve rated the mayor‚Äôs comparison False. In an email Thursday, mayoral spokesman Darren Pudgil acknowledged the error. He said Sanders‚Äô meant to say San Diego will be one of the first cities that doesn‚Äôt subsidize bike-sharing. The mayor made that point during his press conference about bike-sharing and in a press release sent to reporters, Pudgil said. To our knowledge, Sanders only made the incorrect claim during the Fox 5 interview, which was broadcast across the region. ‚ÄúI hope that you will not use the mayor‚Äôs error to suggest that he is misleading people on this,‚Äù Pudgil wrote. ‚ÄúHe knows it‚Äôs ONE. He simply misspoke.‚Äù Regardless, Sanders‚Äô statement still fits our definition of False. The definition says: ‚ÄúThe statement is not accurate. This could be an error or misstatement but it‚Äôs simply not true and there is no element of truth to it.‚Äù If you disagree with our determination or analysis, please express your thoughts in the comments section of this blog post.
