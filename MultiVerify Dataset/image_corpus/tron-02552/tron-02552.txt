Glass bottom sky walk at the Grand Canyon-Truth! / Miscellaneous / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Glass Bottom Skywalk at the Grand Canyon- Truth! Summary of eRumor: The eRumor includes an artists conception of a new attraction being built at the Grand Canyon:  A walkway jutting out from the side of the canyon that is made of glass on the bottom and the sides.  You’ll walk into what feels like air 4,000 feet above the floor of the canyon.  The walkway is said to be made from a million pounds of steel, could hold 70 million pounds and survive an 8.0 earthquake. The Truth: At the time that this eRumor began circulating the Grand Canyon Skywalk was in construction and the artist’s rendering showed what it was to look like. The Skywalk was completed and opened in March, 2007. A new eRumor is circulating complaining about the cost of visiting the new attraction.  Admission is $25 per person but visitors have also discovered that the Indian reservation is charging an additional $50 per person to be admitted to the reservation itself..  The $75 total includes a bus ride to the Skywalk  itself, then to Guano Point, which has a good view of the canyon, a simple buffet meal, and another bus trip, if you wish, to a ranch that also has a petting zoo. Another irritation to tourists is that apparently they don’t allow cameras to go with you to the Skywalk. .
