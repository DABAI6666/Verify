Summary of eRumor: A warning about the popular beverage, Red Bull, claiming that is is loaded with caffeine and can lead to cardiovascular problems.   The eRumor claims that the product has been banned in three countries. The Truth: A Red Bull Spokesperson told truthorfiction.com that the Energy drink is a safe consumer product and that it’s main  ingredients are taurine, glucuronolactone and caffeine.     Red Bull only contains about as much caffeine as a regular cup of mild filtered coffee and is not banned in any country, although some countries may enforce restrictions on the packaging method of vitamins. We have also not found any documented independent evidence that supports the contention of the eRumor. One should avoid caffeinated drinks if under doctors orders to so.
