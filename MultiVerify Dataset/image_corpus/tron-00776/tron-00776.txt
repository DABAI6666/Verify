Julie Andrews singing about aging-Fiction! / Celebrities / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Julie Andrews Singing an Age-Related Parody of the Song My Favorite Things – Fiction! Summary of eRumor: The eRumor describes a 69th birthday event on October 1 at which singer/actress Julie Andrews sang a humorous rendition of My Favorite Things, a song she helped make famous in the film The Sound of Music .  The eRumor says the event was at Radio City Music Hall in New York and was a benefit concert for AARP. The Truth: Julie Andrew’s birth date is indeed October 1 and her 69th birthday was in 2004.  This eRumor started circulating in 2005. The problem is that none of the story is true. There was no performance by Julie Andrews in 2004 at the Radio City Music Hall and to our knowledge she has never sung the humorous age-related parody of the words from the song My Favorite Things .
