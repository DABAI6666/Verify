Target Coupon on Facebook Offers 50% Off-Fiction! / Business / By Rich Buhler & Staff / November 30, 2015 Target Coupon on Facebook Offers 50% Off- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: A Target coupon that appeared on Facebook offered shoppers 50% off purchases made at Target retail stores just in time for Black Friday. The Truth: A 50% off Target coupon appearing on Facebook is a survey scam. The Target coupon hoax appeared in November 2015, so many shoppers falsely believed that it was part of the store’s Black Friday sales events. The Target coupon encouraged people to “share” the coupon with their friends, comment “Thanks!” on the post, click “like” and then enter personal information required to redeem the coupon. This is a survey scam in which you’re tricked into giving your personal information to scammers who then sell it to others or use it to sign you up for expensive subscriptions without your permission. The first giveaway that the so-called Target coupon is a hoax is that it’s offered through a third-party website called x-mascoupons.com — not Target’s official website. The fact that the Target coupon was not posted from the official Target Facebook page, which has a blue “verified” checkmark, is another giveaway that this is a hoax.
