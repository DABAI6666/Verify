With the elections over, the flow of bold statements from San Diego‚Äôs political world has slowed, and our reporters have more time to Fact Check other claims about life in San Diego ‚Äî including urban legends. We‚Äôd like your help. We hear plenty of wild claims about our town. That Qualcomm Stadium‚Äôs parking lot is the largest parking lot this side of the Mississippi River. That the San Ysidro border crossing is the busiest in the country . That a famous piece of the Wild Animal Park actually got its name in a practical joke . That Jimmy Hoffa‚Äôs body is buried off the coast of Point Loma (OK, well, maybe not that one). What have you heard about San Diego that you‚Äôve always wanted checked out? Have any suspicions, or knowledge, that some are urban legends? Take a few moments, send an email to factcheck@voiceofsandiego.org . It‚Äôs that easy. If you have any questions, or prefer to talk on the phone about the story you want fact checked, don‚Äôt hesitate to contact me, too. Please contact Keegan Kyle directly at keegan.kyle@voiceofsandiego.org or 619.550.5668 and follow him on Twitter: twitter.com/keegankyle .
