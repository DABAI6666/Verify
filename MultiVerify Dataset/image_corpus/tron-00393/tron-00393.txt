Video Shows High Diving Giraffes-Fiction! / Animals / By Rich Buhler & Staff / February 17, 2016 Video Shows High Diving Giraffes- Fiction! People are wondering if a viral video showing what appear to be high diving giraffes jumping into a pool is real. The Truth: The high diving giraffes video shows spectacular computer animation, not actual giraffes jumping into a pool. The high diving giraffes animation is the work of Nicolas Deveauxa, a French director at Cube Creative Products. Deveauxa said his work often combines his “passion for imagery with one for animals.” That pretty much sums up the high diving giraffes video, officially titled “5 Metres 80”. Nicolas Deveauxa also animated a wildly popular video of an elephant jumping on a trampoline called “ 7 tonnes 2 ”. It’s not clear how the high diving giraffes video was mistaken for the real thing, but the full video was likely chopped into shorter clips that made the footage appear much more lifelike.
