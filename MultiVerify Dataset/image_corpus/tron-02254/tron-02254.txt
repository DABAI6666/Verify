Wal-Mart-Fiction! Forward an email to help a badly burned 6-year old injured in a fire at
Wal-Mart-Fiction! / Medical , Pleas / By Rich Buhler & Staff / March 17, 2015 Forward an Email to Help Cover Medical Costs for a 6-year old Badly Burned in a Fire at Wal-Mart- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: A story about a 6-year old girl who, while on a visit to Wal-Mart with her brother, gets trapped in a bathroom during a fire.  At first her family assumes she has died but they later learn she’s in the hospital, is severely burned, and needs surgery.  The family can’t pay for it, but you can help because AOL is going to give $2 toward her medical care for every email that is forwarded around the Internet. The Truth: There is no evidence this every happened and even if it did, there is no money being given by AOL for forwarding the email.  There is no procedure being used on the Internet by anybody to trace forwarded emails for the purpose of compensating yourself or anybody else.  The story is a hoax, and a badly written one at that.  The story is not believable, does not have any factual information that would allow it to be verified (such as the city where this took place).
