The Moon Will Duplicate 37 Times on September 5-Fiction! / Space / Aviation / By Rich Buhler & Staff / August 27, 2015 The Moon Will Duplicate 37 Times on September 5- Fiction! Summary of eRumor: Rumors that the moon with duplicate 37 times on September 5, 2015, have made the rounds online. The Truth: Don’t expect to see the moon duplicate 37 times on September 5 because this rumor is a hoax. It’s not clear exactly where the rumor started, but a website called The Racket Report published a story that told sky gazers to expect “spectacular moon viewing” on September 5: Positioned at a distance from Earth of 22 light years, we see the moon as it was 22 years ago. But on September 5, we will see a reflection of the last 37 years due to a cosmic light anomaly reflection from the sun. Be sure to share this with your friends so they do not miss this once-in-a-lifetime event! Remember, this will not happen again for nearly 260 years. The story has been shared tens of thousands of times on social media sites — but lots of those people will be disappointed to find just one moon in the sky on September 5. It takes the moon 29.5 days to circle the earth, and each orbit is called a lunar cycle. The moon looks different in each phase because of how it reflects the sun’s light and the angle we see it from. But 37 duplicate moons won’t appear in the sky on September 5 , or on any other day, according to a calendar of moon phases on the StartDate website.
