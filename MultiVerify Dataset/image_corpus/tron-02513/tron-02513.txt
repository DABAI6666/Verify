Summary of eRumor: The message says there is a class action that applies to anyone who bought a CD between 1995 and 2000.  It gives a website where you can apply and possibly receive $20. The Truth: The Attorneys General for 43 states and other areas have filed antitrust lawsuits against several music companies. They have alleged that the companies illegally conspired to raise the prices of CD’s and other music products by implementing minimum advertised price policies.  In the proposed settlement, the companies would pay more than $65 million in settlements.  Anyone who purchased “prerecorded music products” such as CD’s, cassettes, and records between January 1, 1999 and December 22, 2000 could be eligible.  An online claim form can be filled out at www.musiccdsettlement.com. The payment will be a maximum of $20 per person no matter how many CD’s have previously been purchased.  If the number of persons filing claims is large enough to bring the return to less than $5 per person, there will be no payments to individuals  Instead, the money would be handed out to non-profit or government groups for music related or other programs designed to benefit those who’ve purchased music products.  Additionally, the defending companies have agreed to distribute more than $75 million dollars worth of music CD’s to non-profit or governmental agencies.
